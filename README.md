# BloodBankManagement
A simple Blood Bank Management System written in C++

I initially made this project for my first semester programming fundamentals course. I then promptly forgot about this project until now when I have decided to dust off this project and explore further possibilities for this project.

__________________________
END USERS:

System Administrator:
To view inventory in the blood bank, view history of donations and transfusions, viewusers using the blood bank and manage their personal information while being able to add new users to the system.

Patient:
A patient can use the blood bank system to receive transfusions and donate blood once they areadded by the Administrator. They can view and edit their personal information.
_________________________

The Blood Bank Management System will take advantage of several concepts of the Object Oriented Programming design paradigm to simplify the complexity of the task and to keep the code reasonably intuitive and scalable. These include but are not limited to:

Classes
Inheritance
Method Overloading
Operator Overloading
Friend Classes
Static Methods
